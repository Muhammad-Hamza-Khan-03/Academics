3.1. Based on the given case study, the incremental model would fit best based on stakeholders requirements. This is because the development of the DBS cannot realistically be completed within the scheduled timeframe along with the fact that the system would be delivered in increments to eventually be in working phase.As a result, the system will be delivered in incremental nature i.e one process at a time based on previous one.

3.2. The stages of the incremental model that could be implemented in the given case study are:

Collecting Requirements:
	The requirements will be collected,gathered and analysed from the stakeholders necessary to build the system.In this case, the stakeholders are airport, airlines, passengers, and airport staff.

Design:
 Creating a design for the system that meets the requirements of the stakeholders. This will include designing the physical layout of the system, the software components, and the user interface.

Implementation:
 Developing and testing the system components based on the design. This will include writing and testing the software components, as well as building and testing the physical components.

Testing:
 Testing the system components to ensure they meet the requirements of the stakeholders. This will include unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.

Deployment:
 Deploying the system to the airport, airlines, and airport staff. This will include installing and configuring the physical components, as well as installing and configuring the software components.

Maintenance:
 Maintaining the system to ensure it remains operational and meets the needs of the stakeholders. This will include providing ongoing support, fixing bugs and issues, and updating the system as needed.

3.3. 
Advantages:
The incremental model allows quick and intime deliverey of a system which aligns with the needs of the stakeholders.
The feedback and response of the stakeholder are considered which can help ensure that the system meets their needs.
It allows for issues and bugs to be identified and addressed early in the development process.
The model can accomodate changes.

Disadvantages:
It may require more resources to develop and test the system incrementally.
The system needs to be well planned.

4.1. Based on the given information, waterfall model will be used. This is because the system has well defined requirements and no proper testing is required at each itteration. Moreover , it is mentioned that a backup already exists in the manual form in case of software failure. 

4.2 

4.3. The issues faced by customers with the web interface, such as irrelevant content, visual hierarchy issues, and session timeouts, can be addressed during the Sprint cycles of the Agile model. User feedback can be used to improve the design and functionality of the interface in each iteration. Additionally, training and gradual deployment can be used to address cultural issues with using the web interface.

4.4. An iterative and incremental process model like Agile or Scrum would be a good fit for improving this system.
The issues faced by customers with the web interface, such as irrelevant content, visual hierarchy issues, and session timeouts, can be addressed during the Sprint cycles of the Agile model. User feedback can be used to improve the design and functionality of the interface in each iteration. Additionally, training and gradual deployment can be used to address cultural issues with using the web interface.

Assuming an Agile approach, the stages/phases for the given case study could be:

Planning: Define project requirements, goals, and stakeholders. Create a product backlog.
Sprint 0: Establish project infrastructure and initial product backlog grooming.
Sprint 1: Develop a prototype web interface with basic functionality and user feedback.
Sprint 2-4: Iterate on the prototype, adding new features and addressing customer feedback. Ensure that the web interface is intuitive, flexible, and secure. Conduct extensive testing to ensure code integrity and robustness.
Sprint 5: Final testing, bug fixing, and product delivery.
